Once upon a time there was a big bad wolf named Mr.Wolf. Mr.Wolf enjoyed scaring the citizens of the peaceful town of Storyland. 
Mr.Wolf would go to people's houses and do all sorts of scary things. One particularly scary prank was when Mr.Wolf rung the doorbell of Mrs.Sheep's house, and
before she had a chance to open the door to see who it was, Mr.Wolf ran away laughing and laughing at all the evil he had just done. Some may call this a 
harmless "Ding-Dong-Ditch", but to the citizens of Storyland, uncertainty and mystery was the most frightening thing of all. One day, after a string of 
Ding-Dong-Ditches, the three mighty brothers of the town, the 3 little pigs, had had enough of Mr.Wolf's ruthless activities. They cornered him on the street and 
told him that if he ever tried to Ding-Dong-Ditch again, they would find him and bring him to justice. Mr.Wolf, as big and bad and mighty as he was, was not scared
one bit, and formed a plan to give those 3 pigs what they deserved. He decided that instead of ding dong ditching, he would try and knock their house down with the 
sheer force of his lungs.
